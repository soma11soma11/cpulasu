Now write a program that uses passing variables by reference. 

Write a program that uses two functions:

calculate(input1, input2, operation, result);
printEquation(input1, input2, operation, result);
Input, input2, and result are floats.
Operation is a char. The choices are '+', '-', '*', '/' 
The result is modified by the function called calculate.
